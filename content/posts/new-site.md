Thank everyone who contributed to the site, was something I needed to do but
didn't know how to do it at the moment.  It's been a long time coming but it's
a clean skeleton of the future.

I wish we as a people did more to help our own.  If we could somehow realize
the potential we have as a group.  If we could realize that the greatest
potential we have as human beings is organizing groups I feel we would come a
long way.  With so much focus today on the individual I thought it's worth
mentioning to not forget about the group.

Mention the people that passed: Dave, Eddie, Milica...

Putting Tanja out into the world.

Hoping to help all of our fallen heroes have a decent and proper place in the
world, so their stories can continue to inspire us and the generations to come.
