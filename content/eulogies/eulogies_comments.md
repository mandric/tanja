## Our Dearest Tanja, Our Dearest Andric’s,

By Cika Rade Vukcevich

Occasionally the blood of a small nation like ours produces a bold spirit that
courses through its arteries replenishing the collective soul of its people.
That spirit is like a beacon that lights the way in the sea of human struggles
and points a way to our better selves. Such was the child borne of your love,
a wondrous gift of the Creative Magnificence delivered into the waiting arms
of your family. You loved her beyond limits, yet you were not selfish. You
shared her with the rest of us. Thank you. Her name was Tanja.

The friendship between our families brought her from your open arms and hearts
into our home. She came with love from a family full of love. There is no
better way to human unity, human togetherness, human happiness. We saw her as
our own; we joyed in her presence, we laughed in her child’s play and we
watched her grow into adulthood. In all that time a special spark in her eyes
became brighter and brighter as she matured from a child, to a teenager, to a
beautiful young lady. The innocent questions that she asked as a child slowly
turned into complex inquiries into life, science and philosophy, the answers
to which required careful retrospect. That inquisitive spark turned into a
glint of perception, and her questions and comments into thuderbolts that
disarmed one’s intellect. However, in spite of her great thirst to know more,
and in spite of knowing more, she remained humble and mild. Her face was
always behind a benevolent smile denying that she knew more than those around
her. Such was our Tanja.

Now, she is no longer - Unbelievable! Great Emptiness! Huge Loss for All of
Us! Can these few words possibly tell of our great sorrow? NEVER, EVER! Words
are but poor shadows barely touching our thoughts that are now rending our
hearts. We tell ourselves that she is asleep now in the arms of the Creator.
That is our solace. Yet in our minds she is still with us. She will always
live there as a part of our favorite moment in her company frozen in time.



## In Memory of Tanja

By Zoran Terzic

When I was asked if I could say a few words in Tanja's memory, the question
wasn't if I would or could, rather it was where do I start. As most or some of
you know, we, meaning the Terzic's and the Andric's go back a long way, all
the way back to and prior to Tanja's birth. It started with my grandfather and
Tanja's grandfather, Deda Djole, they, being best of friends and neighbors.
That friendship continued through my parents, Mila and Sole, and Momo and
Sneza. It has manifested itself into a family affair, with me, my wife Angie,
and my kids, to Tanja, Naty, and Milan. And now it has come full circle with
Milan's wife Ana and their two beautiful children, Elena and Ivo to my kids…….
Christopher, Michael and Maja.

You are going to hear that word "family" a lot tonight from me and that is
because I feel and know in my heart that we are not "like" family we "are"
family. I know Tanja and her family feel the same way as I do.

From the beginning when we lived close to each other, first on Avenue J, on
the East Side, to both of our families move to Lansing, where just by fate we
had the same house number, our families have been in-separable. Through thick
and thin we have been at each others sides, through the good times and through
the bad times, from Tanja's car accident through her unbelievable fights with
Meningitis, that finally she succumbed to on June 11th 2007.

Now I want to say a couple of things about my personal relationship with my
Tanji. One of the things that drew me and Tanji close was our sense of humor.
I know Tanji would always say to me that I was always able to make her laugh,
and when she would come over to my house in Lansing when I first got married,
she would be going through tough times and just come over so I could make her
laugh. I remember when my first child was born Christopher, whom she
affectionately called "pooper", she would say to me "Zoki, I hope and pray he
has your sense of humor". As hard as things were for Tanji at times, she
always depended on me to make her laugh. And here I am today, standing here,
not being able to say anything remotely funny or hear my Tanji laugh again.

In closing I want to extend my deepest sympathies to my best friends in the
whole world, Momo and Sneza, who have, my entire life, stood by me in my bad
times and good times and have never wavered their love for me. I stand here
today to declare that they will always have me by their side from here to
eternity, because some things are meant to be and I believe in my heart, that
we, the Terzic's and Andric's were meant to be together always.

May God give my Tanji eternal peace, that she so richly deserved, but didn't
always get on Earth.



## In Memory of: Tanja, my sister

June 18th, 2007  
By [Natasha Andric](mailto:natasha@andric.us)

I have so many memories that will keep Tanja with me always. I am honored to
share with you some thoughts and stories so that you might know my sister a
little bit better, because there is so much to know. She was always the
bravest and strongest one in our family. Today I want to honor her strength
and beauty and will try to be strong as she always encouraged me to be.

Tanja is and will always be the most precious gift in my life. For me, Tanja
is larger than life, she had an indomitable spirit. Her limitless energy and
love for life overwhelmed everyone around her, she could work a 12-hour day,
read 3 books, play 2 games of volleyball, and bake a cake all in a single day.
Despite the difficulties that she faced; surgeries, years of doctors and
hospitals, Tanja met every single day with pure determination and conviction.

I feel so proud and fortunate to have Tanja as my sister, she was so loving to
me every single day. Every birthday I had a beautiful, poetic card written
especially for me and she always made me feel like the most special person in
the world. And I know that whoever she loved felt the same way. Tanja achieved
a lot in her life, throughout high school, college, and later in her
professional career Tanja received numerous awards and titles recognizing her
brilliance. However, the title that she was most proud of was Tetka (Aunt), to
be more accurate SuperTetka (as we nicknamed her.) It seems that her mind was
never at rest, as she devoted much of her time looking for new ways of
expressing her enormous love toward family and friends, especially Elena and
Ivo.

Tanja truly cherished people. She never let an important moment pass, she
always took the time to make each second count, each word, each action
meaningful. My junior year of college I spent a year teaching English to
Russian children, I was so homesick and I remember running to the central post
office every Sunday to pick up the week's worth of letters that Tanja had
written to me- each one so funny and incredible.

I really don't know anyone who had as many interests as Tanja, she loved so
many things in life. She loved science, dancing, sports, arts, horseback
riding, books, and good food (ice cream and ketchup, among her favorites.) But
most of all she loved learning and teaching. Tanja was always wondering how
much, or how much more she could carry in her head. She believed that the mind
was a palace, and she dedicated most of her life to building her own. Tanja
was an incredible teacher, she was always there to guide and encourage Milan
and I in our academic endeavors, with her strong support and inspiration we
could accomplish anything.

Tanja also had a great sense of humor that would take you off guard, but she
was serious about life and knew how to value it. She was fiercely devoted and
loyal to her family and friends.

Tanja loved a real life, a true life and had no time for false praise or
insincere compliments. She was so many things; her complexity was part of her
strength. She was deep; she was true; she had been through a lot; she kept
going; she gave to others; she didn't take enough for herself; she was a
daughter, aunt, student, and teacher- she was my sister. Because of who she
was, her death is not just a loss to my family, to this church, to her work,
but also to humanity. Thank you God for Tanja's life; it was and is a gift to
us all.

Last night while trying to put pen to paper after the wake, I was going
through some of her books and papers and this little picture of Tanja fell
out, on the back was written

"Dear Naty, Always remember to love life, as I have always loved you"

"No matter where I am"

"Love, your sis, Tanja"



## My Dear Kumica Tanja

By Zorica Nedeljkovic

It has changed…  
It has forever changed…  
Life will never be the same without you.

Never will I see your beautiful smile again.  
The smile that burst like the brightness of the sun.  
Never will I hear your beautiful voice again.  
The voice that would say:  
"Hey! What's up Kuma?"  
"How are you?"

Never again will I feel your strong hugs.  
The hugs that made you feel warm, safe, and Oh so much better.  
Never again will I be listened to as though what I said mattered…  
And never will I hear from your lips what really matters.

Yet, that is not, what I would hear from you,  
Dear Tanja The eternal optimist in you would say:  
"Never say never Kuma"  
"Things will get better Kuma"  
"Pray Kuma"

I did just that, Tanja, I prayed.  
I prayed and I thanked God for gracing us  
With your presence in our lives. I pray to God  
to give to you, my Angel, a place at His side  
in Heaven, and for the rest of us, who will miss you, Peace.

We will all miss and love you forever…  
Vecnaja Pamjat my Dear Kumica

Kuma Zorica and Family



## In Honor of Tanja

By [Jasmina Ristev](mailto:ristev1@hotmail.com)

My name is Mina Ristev and the Andric family have been my Kumovi for the past
28 years. No one in this room truly understands the loss that this family
feels today. We cannot say that Tanja had it easy in life. She was constantly
being challenged. Where most people would feel sorrow, Tanja rose above these
challenges and lived life to the fullest. She wasn’t afraid to take risks. We
could all learn from her example, to appreciate all that is given to us, to
take advantage of opportunities that come our way and most importantly to
cherish those we love. Tanja was an extraordinary human being. She accepted
people for who they were and she was always willing to help those less
fortunate. She had an infectious laugh that could make anyone smile. She was
very intellectual and analytical and sometimes had to be pried away from her
studies.

However, no matter how busy Tanja was or how much she had on her plate, she
always took time out for family. The people she loved were always her number
one priority. For that reason, I truly believe that Tanja was an angel her on
earth for each and every one of us. Her purpose here was to love each of us to
the fullest and give 100% of herself to enrich our lives. She will truly be
missed. Although physically, she is not here with us today, Tanja will live on
in our hearts and in our memories. I know that she will continue to be our
angel from up above in heaven. Kumovi, on behalf of the Ristev family, we are
so incredibly sorry for your loss. We love you and we will always be here for
you.

Love,  
Mina Ristev



## For Tanja

By [Kristina Ristev](mailto:ristev1@hotmail.com)

Words cannot in any way be shaped or molded to soften the grief that many of
us are feeling today over the loss of our beloved Tanja. To me she was known
as Tanjee and she held a very special place in my heart and her passing is no
simple loss. She was an angel in every sense of the word; she was caring,
giving, honest, selfless, and most of all pure of heart and soul. And every
person in her life was personally touched by these extraordinary qualities. We
were fortunate to have such an angel with us here on earth but now god has
asked that she come home, where she will remain in peace and serenity as she
so greatly deserves. And although she has gone Tanja will forever live in our
hearts and memories.  
Love,  
Tina Ristev

Tanja Andric meant so much to so many of us, especially to me.

She touched our lives with her kindness and generosity. She was always so full
of life and so much encouragement and optimism.

I vividly remember…almost like it was yesterday…being in eighth grade and
looking forward to high school. I got to high school and saw Tanja’s pictures
hanging all over Thornwood High School. She was so modest she never said
anything about being involved in absolutely everything.

Not only was she a top scholar, one of the best and brightest, but she was
loved by ALL and involved in every sport and activity you could possibly think
of, from speech and debate to volleyball and track.

You name it, Tanja did it.

Quickly, she became my mentor, my encouragement…someone who I looked up to
with great respect and admiration.

Since I can remember, she was, and always will be a great friend.

I can’t count how many birthdays, slavas, holidays, and events our families
spent together and this lead to countless wonderful memories and numerous
conversations of encouragement, optimism, and scholarly words of wisdom from
Tanja.

She always gave hope when the road ahead looked bleak and impassible.

Her brilliance and scholarly wisdom helped me not only throughout my
schooling, but it helped me to become a better person in life because of the
special bond that I shared with Tanja.

Because of our beautiful, wonderful, gracious, and amazing Tanja, I am touched
more than I could ever express here in words of how she touched my life and my
family’s life.

Her positive attitude and selfless advice will never be forgotten.

She will always live on and hold, in my heart, a very special place as my
dear, dear, irreplaceable friend, Tanja.

Tanji, you will be greatly missed and no words could ever describe the loss we
are facing.

Cika Momo, Tetka Sneza, Naty, Milan, Ana, Elena, and Ivo, our thoughts and
prayers are with you and with our Tanji and always will be.

I know she is now in a better place with God.

God Bless our Tanji. We love you so much.

May her memory be Eternal.

Neka joj Bog podari Rajsko Naselje i neka joj bude Vjecna Ja Pamjat.

Love you always,

Natalie and George Manojlovic  
June 2007

Milan and Family,

A truely tragic loss for you and the world. There never is enough that you can
say about the loss of a loved one. Perhaps the best way to emote is to
remember all that she gave to the world… the world that revolved around her.
Remembering that she did, indeed, make her mark, was loved, gave love, and had
a lasting affect on everyone she touched.  
Our family's thoughts and prayers are with you.

Best,

Roy

Dear Milan,

It has been a privilege for us to know the Andric family for several years and
we always admired how much you loved and cared for each other. Tania was an
integral part of your close kinship; always supportive, loving, helpful and
thoughtful. We are truly sorry for your loss. She will be missed forever.

In this unbearable time, draw your strength upon your family and friends. Ask
for anything.

Please give our condolences to your parents, Nati and Ana.

We love you all very much,

Our condolences to Milan and the Andric family;

We are also deeply heart broken. It is hard to believe that such lovely spirit
had to leave our presence that soon.

Every time we were around Tanja, the place was filed with a pure and honest
feeling; she was truly kind, intelligent and an interesting person to stay
with. We miss her…  
It was impressive; her dedication for the family and specially Elena and Ivo
was admirable.

It is time to be strong and celebrate life; celebrate Tanja’s life. Good bless
Tanja and the Andric family.

Sincerely yours;  
Gui & Guigo

Mere words cannot convey the sadness we feel at the loss of Tanja. She was
simply an amazing girl who had such great strength, kindness, determination
and spirit. May God give the Andric family the strength to carry on and to get
you through this extremely sad time. As the late Bishop Iriney said, God only
picks the most beautiful flowers for his garden. He has certainly picked an
extraodinary one this time.

May Tanja's memory be eternal. Vecnaja Pamjat.

sorry for your loss.

As I have been thinking about Tanja the past few days, I remember her strong
sense of self, her depth and her absolute integrity. I have also been thinking
about how much fun we had dancing! at Milan's wedding, at Lou Conte's school
for dance and at my wedding last August…so much JOY!

We are keeping you in our thoughts and prayers. We love your family dearly.
Love, Katie & John.

Tanja touched each of us with her special gifts of kindness, intelligence,
empathy and warmth. She truly made everyone feel important which we know came
from her beautiful parents, Snezana and Momcilo. We all feel she was an angel
here on earth to her family and friends and now she is needed in heaven. We
will all be together with her again one day but until then, she will always
live on in our hearts.

I was very saddened to hear about Tanja, though we had not been in touch for
sometime she always had a special place in my heart. We were best friends in
junior high school and I'll never forget her. We laughed all the time and I
have a lot of fond memories of her. I ran into her a couple of years ago at a
mutual friend's birthday party and we talked about getting together for coffee
to catch up and I regret that I never followed up with that. My sincerest
condolences to her family and she will definitely remain close to me in my
heart.

I have truly been blessed to have known Tanja and her Dear family. Through
high school and college, Tanja was such a source of inspiration to me. Her
love of her family, her strong sense of herself and her multitude of
accomplishments made her my personal hero. She left such a rare positive
influence on all the hearts she touched and I believe anyone who has crossed
her path in her short life will never forget her. There is only one "Tanja".
Even though 18+ years have passed, my family still thinks of her with love and
laughter for that is what she always brought to the table. On a recent visit
to my Uncle's (who lives on Australia), he even asked about her (and had not
seen her since 1990) and said she was such a unique, honest and special
person. She was the best and my life is better because I had known her. To the
Andric family: thank you for letting me be a small part of Tanja's life. You
are all in my thoughts and prayers.

Dear Andric Family:

I was so stunned and saddened to see Tanja's obituary in The Times. I was one
of Tanja's teachers at Memorial Junior High School in Lansing when she was in
the Gifted Program. I remember her as a "star" in our Future Problem Solving
Program as we went on to state competition. In fact, Mrs. Andric, you drove us
to the competition downstate. Tanja was my daughter's age and so I empathize
even more with your horrific, tragic loss. It is a loss not only for all of
Tanja's wonderful family and friends but for the world as well. We have all
lost a treasure with so much more to give.  
We cannot understand why this had to happen but we have to believe that
Tanja's spirit and love will live on in this world as she is enjoying the
wonder, beauty and love of the next world.  
Please know that you are all in my prayers. God be with you…

Sincerely yours in sympathy and remembrance,

To the Andric Family,

Please accept our deepest condolences! Our family was saddened by Tanja’s
untimely death. Tanja was a very classy young lady. It pains me to see that
the Serbian community has lost another young star in its dwindling galaxy.
There aren’t any magic words to help ease your pain; at least I haven’t heard
them yet. All you can do is take comfort in the respect and admiration that
your daughter earned during her short time on Earth, and know that you raised
an intelligent, thoughtful, and proud young lady. I know that right now she
has at least one good friend who will make sure that she is safe.

child. I know there are no words that will ease your pain. May God and her

TO the Andric Family,

Our deepest condolences on the passing of Tanja. I remember growing up on the
East Side together and playing whenever my mom and I went to your house for
haircuts and then dancing in the folkore group together and hanging out at the
Hinich's. Although we didn't see much of each other the past few years,
whenever we did run into each other we always had the best time talking and
catching up. I always had a deep admiration for Tanja. She amazed me with her
intelligence, her drive and ambition, her sense of humor and most of all with
her huge capacity to love.

Aleks met her when he and I got married and the two of them really shared a
special connection. Like me, he saw Tanja as an amazing individual. We realize
that nothing can take the pain away..but be comforted knowing that she is in a
better place…where this is no pain, illness or sorrow. Everyone knows she was
very protective of her family and friends and she will continue to be as she
watches over all those who she loved. She touched everyone who knew her and
all of our lives are better for having known her. May she rest in eternal
peace and may God Bless all of you.

Vecnaja Pamjat.

Iskrala se iskra iz tvoga oka  
Pokazala mi sta je svetlost prava.  
Oci su zaspale,  
Ali svetlost jos uvek obasjava celu vasionu.

Otkucalo je srce  
Pesmu hriscanske ljubavi.  
Pesma je prestala,  
Ali ljubav jos uvek uci covecanstvo da voli.

Borila se dusa  
U surovom svetu.  
Borba je prestala,  
Ali me je tvoja snaga ucinila hrabrijom i jacom.

Posmatram nebo  
I novu sjajnu zvezdu.  
Namignem joj tajno,  
Jer je iskra sto se iskrala iz tvoga oka.

Dearest Andric Family,

Tanja was truly a remarkable person; her love, kindness and strength touched
us all. She will always be in my thoughts, prayers and heart.

My heartfelt condolences to you all. God Bless You.

Dear Andric family,

I met Tanja through my long friendship with Milan in Berkeley. Tanja and I had
wonderful conversations over email and in person, and perhaps connected
quickly since we are both women in science from immigrant families. I was
struck by her determination and grace and directness, the way she carried
herself with a sense of humour and awareness, totally absent of the cynicism
that sometimes accompanies difficult life struggles. I cannot even begin to
express how shocked and saddened I was to hear the news of her passing. I know
you have lost a precious sister and daughter, but the story of her life
continues, and I know she will be a role model and mentor for many young
people. On that note, I am including a poem of celebration for Tanja and her
accomplishments. May her memory live on.

with love

_When Death Comes_

When death comes  
like the hungry bear in autumn;  
when death comes and takes all the bright coins from his purse

to buy me, and snaps the purse shut;  
when death comes  
like the measle-pox

when death comes  
like an iceberg between the shoulder blades,

I want to step through the door full of curiosity, wondering:  
what is it going to be like, that cottage of darkness?

And therefore I look upon everything  
as a brotherhood and a sisterhood,  
and I look upon time as no more than an idea,  
and I consider eternity as another possibility,

and I think of each life as a flower, as common  
as a field daisy, and as singular,

and each name a comfortable music in the mouth,  
tending, as all music does, toward silence,

and each body a lion of courage, and something  
precious to the earth.

When it's over, I want to say all my life  
I was a bride married to amazement.  
I was the bridegroom, taking the world into my arms.

When it's over, I don't want to wonder  
if I have made of my life something particular, and real.

I don't want to find myself sighing and frightened,  
or full of argument.

I don't want to end up simply having visited this world.

-Mary Oliver

Tanja grew to mean more to me in the short time we worked together than most
people do after years of friendship. We said many times how amazing it was to
have a friend at work, rather than to just be friendly with our co-workers.
Her honesty, strength, and amazing ability to see the true person behind their
facade drew me to her. Her laugh and humor kept me company. The complexities
of her thoughts kept me on my toes. Her existence made me happy and I am a
better person for having known her. I miss my friend very much. She is loved,
she is missed, and she will be remembered. I hope that knowledge can help to
carry some of her family's pain during this impossible time.

With my greatest thanks to you for having shared her with me and my deepest
sympathies for this most profound loss, Mollie

Dear Andric Family,

We are deeply saddened by the loss of your beautiful daughter Tanja. She was a
bright, graceful and strong young woman whose determination is an inspiration
to those who knew her well..and those who heard of her.

The loss you feel is certainly unquenchable by words. However, you should know
that true angels, such as Tanja, never cease to exist.

~The Dash~

I read of a man who stood to speak  
At a funeral of a friend  
He referred to the dates on her tombstone  
From the beginning to the end.

He noted that first came the date of her birth  
And he spoke the following date with tears,  
But he said what mattered most of all  
Was the dash between those years.

For that dash represents all the time  
That she spent alive on earth  
And now only those who loved her  
Know what that little line is worth.

For it matters not how much we own;  
The cars, the house, the cash,  
What matters is how we live and love  
And how we spend our dash.

So think about this long and hard.  
Are there things you'd like to change?  
For you never know how much time is left,  
That can still be rearranged.

If we could just slow down enough  
To consider what's true and real  
And always try to understand  
The way other people feel.

And be less quick to anger,  
And show appreciation more  
And love the people in our lives  
Like we've never loved before.

If we treat each other with respect,  
And more often wear a smile  
Remembering that this special dash  
Might only last a little while.

So, when your eulogy is being read  
With your life's actions to rehash  
Would you be proud of the things they say  
About how you spent your dash?

-Linda Ellis

Our sincerest condolences to your entire family. Tanja's love, loyalty, &
success will not soon be forgotten.

In Memoriam: Tanja, my friend.

June 16, 2007

We did not know it, but my friend Tanja's time on this earth was limited. It
is as if she knew it. She did not waste it living someone else's life.
Sometimes we felt that her behavior was odd. Only too aware of the menace
lurking beneath tranquility, Tanja's breakdowns were not a sign of oddness but
rather a sensitive person's quite sane response to the darkness and cruelties
of life. Tanja was not trapped into living with other people's thinking and
she certainly did not let the noise of their opinions crush her own and very
original voice. She was unique in every way, and I consider it a privilege and
an honor to have known her. The most admirable thing to me about Tanja was
that she did everything her way. She had the courage to follow her heart and
her intuition. In our individual lives, though the years are sad, the days
have a way of being jubilant. Tanja made hers meaningful in the grandest
manner possible; through giving unconditional love to family and friends
alike. In her short story "The Fullness of Life," Edith Wharton wrote that a
woman's life is like "a great house full of rooms," most of which remain
unseen: "and in the innermost room, the holy of holies, the soul sits alone
and waits for a footstep that never comes." My Tanja's real life ended in that
posture of waiting. Those of us who knew Tanja and loved her have spent the
last several days asking ourselves why? Why did so much suffering have to be
parceled out to one individual? Tanja never even bothered to ask. She just
kept on going.

Their's not to make reply,  
Their's not to reason why,  
Their's but to do and die.

Dear Tanja,  
I need to thank you again for all of your support during the most difficult
time of my life three years ago. You and Naty took me in as your own and
provided me with a loving family and shelter that I cannot thank you enough
for. I am so inspired by your drive for life and your devotion to your work. I
will miss our chili cheese dip nights when you, Naty and I would eat the
entire bowl of that stuff. I will always remember how you tutored me in Math
when I was younger and unwilling to learn because I was too busy wanting to
play outside and have fun. You of course saw this and took me to Dairy Queen
and treated me to a sundae even though I did not earn it. You spoiled me so
much.  
In the days since your passing I have been angry with God but I've also been
happy with him because I have learned that my selfish need to have you here on
this earth with us is not something that cannot be fulfilled. God needed you
for a bigger purpose and just could not keep you here on this earth any
longer. I know that we have all gained an angel in the loss of the human being
that we have grown to love here on earth. My Kuma Sneza and my Kum Momo are
wonderful people who I pray will be comforted by God's love and my Kuma Naty
is the greatest person that I have known and will now carry the weight of the
love that you gave to little Elena and Ivan. You gave hope, you gave love, and
ultimately gave everything of yourself for the people that you touched. I will
miss you. I cannot express my gratitude enough to you but I would like to say
that I love you and you will always be in my thoughts and prayers.  
Love,  
Kumic Milan

And you still lie here next to me

If it takes another life

Get used to this  
You're going to be alright  
The world goes on with or without me  
If I don't ever leave a thing behind  
I'll still leave you without me

If it takes another life

To the Andric family,

I am saddened by this news of Tanja's passing. I worked with Tanja at Baxter
and she was not only a co-worker but a good friend. There was many a late
nights working, talking to each other, once-in-while giving her a ride to the
train station. You described her very well and that was the Tanja I knew. Her
love for her family and nieces and nephews were a big part of her life. Her
intelligence challenged many and she would not follow the crowd and stood up
for her beliefs. My prayers are with you. May God give you comfort during
these times.

Tanja's co-worker and friend,

  38. Nedja Tomicic Says:   
June 22nd, 2007 at 6:03 pm

Our dear Andrici,  
First of all our deepest condolences to you. Even though so many of us will be
loving you, empathizing with you, and trying to help every step of the way,
deep down we know that this is a Cross you have been chosen to bear and we can
only hold it up a little bit.

Tanja's passing, though,profoundly enlightens us about the undescribale family
feeling we have within the Serbian community, especially the St. Simeon South
Chicago family. Families far and wide who knew Tanja personally, who knew
someone Tanja knew, who just knew of Tanja have been saddened to the depths of
their heart and soul, just like they lost someone of their dearest, immediate
family. In the midst of working or going about my daily chores, the floodgates
will open and I grieve for you and the other families who had to let their
children go.

I empathise with the Pantovic Family who say there aren't any magic words that
they've heard to help ease their pain. I believe that but all I can say is we
care and we love you. I hope God gives you strength to live in a way that will
celebrate Tanja's life. Tanja achieved soooo much in such a short time and it
is our duty to pass that on. She would be proud and probably humbled by all
the wonderful things that have been said about the way she lived her "dash". I
never really knew the Pantovic family but I have cried endless tears thinking
about their son and how he marked his "dash". It has been pure magic to me to
marvel at how connected we Serbs are because here was someone I never even met
yet I keep talking to people about his life and the way that he enriched
everyone's world. His body is gone but his spirit lives in those he knew and
even in those he did not know. Pano lived his dash in a way that made a big
impact and the story of his life and his personality keeps repeating. The
Pantovic Family writes that the Serbian community has lost another young star
in its dwindling galaxy. Coping with their unbelievable loss, I can empathise
with that. From another angle, though, I feel that the Serbian community has
put another star into the galaxy to shine FOREVER bright. Pano and Tanja and
Milica and Dr. Alavanja, departing this World in a cluster as they did,
created a mini-galaxy that no one can help but notice. I believe they were the
chosen for they, thru their own making and thru the special loving and
honorable position their families hold in the community, can make the greatest
impact. All of them individually and collectively left so much for us to
reflect on and appreciate. While the pain is intense, especially for you, the
meaning is profound for us. When my tata died, my then-12-year-old Pero said
something that stuck with me and comes to my mind time-and-time again,
especially at times like this where I feel I lost someone that touched me so
deeply. He said, "When someone we love passes away, they become part of OUR
soul." When you think about it, all of their greatest qualities are forever in
our heart and soul and we find ourselves living out those qualities and
passing them along, spreading them throught the world to make it a better
world. Our dear Tanja had so many great qualities that will live on and be
passed on thru the millions of people she impacted directly and indirectly.

This collection of thoughts and expressions of sympathy I read at this website
are just a start. Between her family, kumovi and friends and others Tanja
inspired, we could easily write a best-selling motivational book.

My family and I will forever be grateful to Tanja for the loving connection
she made with Milena as a Gracanica camp counselor, thereafter personally
sealing the love that started with my driving my mama Vida Paic to get a
haircut by Sneza and continuing for decades as our lives were interwoven thru
the St. Simeon connection of families and church events. We are blessed beyond
explanation by the Serbian way of life that the Andric family perpetuated,
with the folklore and church participation.

Andrici and their family and Kumovi

June 28th, 2007 at 8:21 am

The news of Tanja's death must be a cause of profound sorrow for all who knew
her, it certainly was for Pamela and I. She was a rare young woman who had
suffered much but through the pain developed a sense of the value of life and
of a firm set of values in living her life. Her hunger for knowledge and
understanding was deeply impressive and we always had the feeling in
conversation of our words and meanings being absorbed and evaluated. She could
be fun, but never trivial. In a world that sometimes creates a feeling of
despair at the stupidity and brutality of so many people, Tanja was a force
for good in her commitment to meaning and understanding. She kept in touch
with us, often talked of coming to visit us in China and we told her she would
be welcome at any time. Sadly, however, it won't happen now. What we are left
with is a deep sense of loss, but the memory of a brave and good person.

We send our heartfelt sympathy to you and you family,

Pamela and John

It was a life rich with the love of family, friends, and values that were deep

Shortly after I met Natasha in college, Tanja became my “big sister” as well.
Even though she was only a year older than me, she was always protective,
encouraging and caring. I can hear her giggle, I can see her dance, and I know
she loved her family and friends. It’s not often that you meet someone with
such purity and compassion. She’ll be greatly missed.

Your family is in my thoughts and in my heart.

It is truly hard and sad to hear this tragedy, losing someone, someone close,
present in all moments. I am really sorry for your loss and know, as I have
lost my dad less than two months ago, the horrible and endless pain you're all
feeling.  
It is a big hole inside our hearts that accopanies us in the mornings,
afternoons and nights… when everything is silent and we cannot stop thinking
of the person who has always made a HUGE difference in our world.  
The only thing that at times make my pain a little bit softer is to think of
the most precious and adorable moments we've lived and shared together, as
friends, family and confidents.  
Please accept my sincere condolences. I truly wish to be closer to all of you
and offer my shoulder in this difficult moment you all have to go through.  
If you need anything, anything at all, please do not hesitate to get in touch
and just say the word.

Although I did not know Tanja well, the news of her passing still lingers in
my mind. Perhaps because she was my age, or I sympathize as a sister and now a
mother. I don't know, but I felt compelled to write. Even though I did not
know Tanja, I remember always seeing The Andric's at 114th Folkfest
performances and zabavas in South Chicago and Indiana. Please accept my
deepest sympathies on the loss of your daughter and sister. From the words
left by those who knew her, she was obviously a woman of grace, intellect, and

Tanja and I were classmates, starting our graduate studies in 2001 at
University of Illinois at Chicago. We would stay up late at night, she with
her frogs, and I with my DNA experiments. We made dry jokes, considering it
was midnight when they were made. For us, they were great jokes. We would
share food, frustrations, laughs and try to study for the final exams, all at
the same time. I am not sure how much we studied but somehow we passed all our
exams.

I just learned of you passing away and I felt a knife in my heart. Tanja,

I was the smallest and youngest of our group and Tanja was the oldest and the

instruction. Later, as an adult, I still looked up to her awed at her
achievements and happy that I was her friend. She, on the other hand, was
always ready with a smile and a hug. I liked that hug. It made me feel warm
and wanted. She is gone now, but I will always look up. I will miss those
hugs, dearest Tanja.

As the 1st anniversary of Tanja's passing rolls around, I ponder for what
seems like the millionth time at the difficulty of coming to accept such
trauma. Tata, mama, brate, sestro, kumovi pokojne Tanje uvek ste u mojim
mislima i molitvama. Sneza i Momo cesto ste mi pred ocima i suosjecam vas bol
ali znam da nemogu ni pomisliti kako vam je. To samo zna onaj ko je kroz takav
rastanak prosao. Randy Pausch, the Professor at Carnage-Mellon who is dying of
pancreatic cancer, recently gave a graduation speech in which he said that
people have commented whether he will beat the reaper. He says no one can beat
the reaper by living longer… it will claim everyone. You can only beat the
reaper by living well. We can all take comfort that Tanja lived well. He goes
on to say that everyone needs to find their passion. It appears Tanja had that
in abundance. We can all agree with Randy that passion is grounded in people
and the relationships with them..not in things or money. Tanja lived by that
measure of passion. She will never ever be forgotten. Thank you for paying the
ultimate sacrifice in giving us an angel to remind us of the value of living
life well.. of reminding us not to complain about little things. Nothing can
compare to the pain of parents losing a child… of a father standing by the
casket on Fathers Day.. of a whole family see-sawing between the joy of having
raised such a wonderful person and the pain of not having that person to have
and to hold and hug every day. Our dear Andrich family, we love you and pray
for you constantly. We cannot take away your pain but believe me, sooooo many
of us have shed many tears this past year in silent empathy and hope that you
know how much we care and that it can somehow make it easier for you. Our
prayers continue with you while we carry the image of Tanja and the
inspiration she provided in life on Earth and in this eternal life.

Dear Tanja,

It has been a long time since you left, however, there are still many things
that remind me of you. I still have the plant pot you got me, soap set too,
the rug we bought together. But more importantly, I remember your energy,
stubbornness, ketchup obsession, being harsh but fair, love for family and
friends, always willing to help, learn, try new things, being open minded. You
never wanted to give up. I remember when I took you on a very long walking
tour from one to the other side of Manhattan, and although you were pretty
tired, you did not complain at the pace, distance, you just kept on going.

Interestingly enough, we also had similar taste in clothes/food. Just to
mention a few stories.  
I remember choosing a pink blouse for Naty while shopping for an event (Mila's
Christening) and realizing that you bought exactly the same blouse once we got
home. On another occasion I almost bought a pair of sneakers I liked, and of
course, I saw the same sneakers at your place as I arrived there later in the
day. Most importantly, I remember resisting one day to buy my favorite ice
cream, only to find it in your freezer as I got back from the store

Time passes by, things change, life goes on, and although you are not with us
any more memory of you still lives and you are regularly in my thoughts.

Petar
